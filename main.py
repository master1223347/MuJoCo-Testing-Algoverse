"""
Experiment Runner Script

This script iterates through a predefined list of scene IDs, runs experiments 
using the `Experimental` class, and aggregates the results. The results are 
stored in a dictionary and optionally saved to a JSON file.

Dependencies:
- openai_agent.py
- scene.py
- simulator.py
- experimental.py

Functions:
- main(): Initializes and runs experiments for each scene ID, stores results, 
  and saves them to a JSON file.

Usage:
Run the script directly to execute experiments and generate results.

Example:
$ python script.py

Output:
- Results for each scene are printed to the console.
- Aggregated results are saved in `aggregated_results.json`.
